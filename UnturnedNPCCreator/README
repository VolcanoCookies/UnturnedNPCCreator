This file will be updated with help everytime a new update for the program rolls out, however a more up-to-date version will be kept on the official support discord.

Loading NPC's
- When filling out folder name fields. Be sure to only give the name of the Character/Vendor etc folder.
- If your NPC is located here: C:\Users\frane\Desktop\UnturnedNPCCreator\Bundles\NPCs\Characters\Chief you would only type "Chief".

If you have questions that aren't asnwered here, go on the official support discord and I will try and help you the best I can.
Either use the program, click on files, then Discord. Or use this link: https://discord.gg/BhJM5ve

Currently the program is only tested on a Windows 10 machine, if you use anything else, especially macOS or linux, and you are experiencing errors, be sure to submit them to the discord server so i can try and optimize the application cross platform. Be sure to specify your operating system.

Q: From where can I load NPC's
A: Currently only from the Bundles folder next to the executable file. This is also where all new NPC's will be created, if you want to load a NPC from somewhere else, first copy it to the Bundles folder next to the executable, then load it like you'd normaly do.

Q: I have the correct name and the NPC is in the Bundles folder but it doesn't load.
A: Make sure that the NPC is in the correct subfolder. Use it like this:
Bundles
	NPCs
		Characters			
		Vendors
		Dialogues
		Quests


You are free to use the program and distribute but need to give credit to the creator.
If you publish any content with NPCs made with this application you need to due credit, "NPC's made with Unturned NPC Creator by Volcano" will do.
