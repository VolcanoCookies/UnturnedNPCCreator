Message_0_Page_0 Thank you for bringing this to my attention!<br><i>*she pulls you aside*</i>
Message_0_Page_1 It's time you should know:<pause> Len's working for me. After they kidnapped Harry I asked him to go undercover and try to infiltrate their gang <pause>- his recent behaviour is all a ruse to convince the real traitor he's on their side.
Message_0_Page_2 Due to his high rank and therefore access to rare supplies they were willing to work with him, even if they were suspicious of a trap. So far they haven't trusted him enough to reveal his accomplice on the ship, but thanks to your investigation I suspect the mole will let his guard down and contact the smugglers to rescue Len.
Message_0_Page_3 You've done a great job so far. If you're discrete you have my permission to work with Len and form a plan to catch the real traitor!
